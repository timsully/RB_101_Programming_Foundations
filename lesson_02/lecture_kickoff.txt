Goal of Ruby lessons:
- build fluency in language syntax
- learn to think like a programmer
- learn to build applications
- debugging mindset

We'll cover a lot of topics, but you can categorize it into 3 main buckets:
- learning to program procedurally
- OOP
- other stuff
  - testing
  - blocks
  - tools
  - problem solving
  - developing familiarity with the language

Learning to Code vs Learning to Program
- first, Ruby grammer & syntax (English grammar/vocabulary)
- second, building applications (writing essays/novels)
- very frustrating to jump between the two
- pseudo code

Looking for help
- Search using the "right phrases"
  - use the stack trace
  - reading error messages
  - adding "ruby"
- Stack Overflow
- Ruby Docs
  - Not Rails Docs, lul.

Asking for Help
- treat us like coworkers
- push everything to github
- forums
- chatrooms
- TA office hours

We're learning: Application Development
- lots of different types of programming
- Ruby is the syntax, good for all kinds of programming

* build a logical mindset and debugging mindset - build a temperament for programming
