Sometimes, the documentation is going to leave you scratching your head.

In a very early assignment at Launch School, you are tasked with writing
a program that loads some text messages from a YAML file. We do this with 
YAML::load_file.

Find the documentation for YAML::load_file.

require 'yaml'
MESSAGES = YAML.load_file('calculator_messages.yml')
